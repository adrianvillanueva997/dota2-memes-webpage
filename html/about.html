                <p>At this point you're probably thinking, what's the point of all this? Is this some kind of joke?</p>
                <p>Why, yes, it is! But it's also not. It's website dedicated to collecting and spreading knowledge of
                    all those glorious dank memes</p>
                <p>But not any meme, only those of Gabe Newell's Valve's Steam's Dota 2 and Artifact! So to begin with,
                    let's see what these games are</p>

                        <p>It's like League of Legends, but better. To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to
                            understand DotA 2. The strategy is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of game
                            theory and stochastic outcomes most of the gameplay will go over a typical viewer's head.
                            There's also Icefrog’s teleological outlook, which is deftly woven into the characterisation
                            of his heroes - Icefrog’s personal philosophy draws heavily from Tolkien literature, for
                            instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly
                            appreciate the depths of the game, to realize that it’s not just a pastime – it says
                            something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike DotA 2 truly ARE idiots- of
                            course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the epistemological consequences of denying
                            creeps, which itself is a cryptic reference to Derrida's metaphysical essay How to Avoid
                            Speaking: Denials. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons
                            scratching their heads in confusion as Icefrog's genius unfolds itself on their computer
                            screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a DotA 2 tattoo. And
                            no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate
                            that they're within 500 MMR points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.</p>
